Structures: forms c++ basics
1. Pointer to Array
2. Pointer to Char
3. Pointer to Strings
4. Pointer to Structures


Syntax: <User-defined data type>

// define
struct student{
    char name[100];
    int roll;
    float age;
};

// use
struct student s1;
s1.name = 'aamir';

struct struct
{
    /* data */
};

//initialisation and assignment together
struct student s1 = {101, 8.9, "Ayana"};

Structures Pointers

int a;      struct student s1;
int *ptr;   struct student *ptr
ptr =  &a;  ptr = &s1; 

Arrow Operator:

(*ptr).code <------> ptr->code

Passing Structures to Function:
void printInfo(struct student s1);

struct student--> is a datatype
int == struct student
